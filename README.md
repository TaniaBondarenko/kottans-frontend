  <p>
  I'm really exciting about GIT. It was my first time working with it.
Thanks to git bash, I feel myself a real programmer.
The command line conception is interesting and adventuring for me. 
   VCS is super usefull fo developers, it helps to improve their code 
and makes their work much easier and stresless. You can always return
to that piece of code, which is the best in your opinion without 
worriing to loose some code or project. Git also makes collaboration
easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source. <br>
 
A Git repository (or repo for short) contains all of the project files and the entire revision history.
To record the changes firstly we should add (index) files to a staging (index) area. Then we make a commit,
Commit takes a picture of what files look like at the moment and stores a reference.<br>

Storing a copy of your Git repo with an online host (such as GitHub or Bitbucket) gives you a centrally located place where you can upload your changes and download changes from others, letting you collaborate more easily with other developers. After you have a remote repository set up, you upload (push) your files and revision history to it. After someone else makes changes to a remote repo, you can download (pull) their changes into your local repo.<br>
Pull requests are a way to discuss changes before merging them into your codebase, and decide if you want to merge it or not.
